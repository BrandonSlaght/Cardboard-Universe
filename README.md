# Cardboard Universe

This is a simple demo that displays detailed models of planets using Google's VR SDK.  Originally started as a fork of [GVR-SceneKit](https://github.com/AndrianBdn/GVR-SceneKit), a boilerplate app for displaying SceneKit scenes in Google's VR.  

Most of this project was done during a hackathon, so your mileage may vary.

Hopefully this will launch on the App Store soon.  

Feel free to mess around with the source code, but please don't rip this off and put it on the App Store.

## Usage 

Build and install the app, and toss your phone in a cardboard viewer.  Make sure you scan the QR code on your viewer to make sure the VR is aligned and in focus.

## TODO
