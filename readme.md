# Cardboard Universe

This is a simple demo that displays detailed models of planets using Google's VR SDK.  Originally started as a fork of [GVR-SceneKit](https://github.com/AndrianBdn/GVR-SceneKit, "GVR-SceneKit"), a boilerplate app for displaying SceneKit scenes in Google's VR.  

Most of this project was done during a hackathon, so your mileage may vary.

[Available on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tiny-planets-vr-for-cardboard/id1231523649, "App Store link")

Code contributions welcome!

## Usage 

Build and install the app, and toss your phone in a cardboard viewer.  Make sure you scan the QR code on your viewer to make sure the VR is aligned and in focus.

## TODO

-Launch Screen

-Forwards and backwards head movement for zooming

-Add acknowledgements for data sources
